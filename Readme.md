# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Implement Custom Interactivity

This example shows how to add a custom interactivity to a dashboard loaded in the [WinForms Dashboard Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117122/winforms-dashboard/winforms-viewer):
- A user can select records in the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150) dashboard item to filter data in the external [Pivot Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3409) control. 
- When a user clicks the chart series, the [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid) control displays the corresponding underlying data.

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

To accomplish this, handle the following events:

* [DashboardViewer.DashboardItemVisualInteractivity](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.DashboardItemVisualInteractivity) event allows you to implement a custom [Master Filtering](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116912).
* [DashboardViewer.DashboardItemSelectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.DashboardItemSelectionChanged) event allows you to filter data in the external [PivotGridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3409) with the records selected in the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150) dashboard item.
* [DashboardViewer.DashboardItemSelectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.DashboardItemSelectionChanged) event allows you to obtain underlying data when the user clicks the chart series.

This example operates with the [MultiDimensionalData](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.ViewerData.MultiDimensionalData) API. For more information on the **MultiDimensionalData** concept, refer to the following document: [Obtain Underlying and Displayed Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/17269/winforms-dashboard/winforms-viewer/obtaining-underlying-and-displayed-data).
